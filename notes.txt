Dear Fukuda-san,

I’ve reviewed the design, and there are a few points I’d like to confirm:

Regarding language switching, I’d like to create a sample file like en.html to make it easier to customize. Or do you prefer using just one HTML file? (This isn’t an issue; it just means there will be more lines of code.)

For the animation of "logo_wearefamily.svg," I noticed the animation repeats after completing. Do you want to keep it that way, or should it only run once?

In the Timeline section, you don’t want the scrollbar to be displayed. So, when the mouse cursor is in the Timeline section, would you like scrolling with the mouse wheel to reveal the next timeline? Or do you prefer a drag function to slide and view it? On mobile, it would be drag to slide and view, right?

Please help me check these points.

Thank you!!
